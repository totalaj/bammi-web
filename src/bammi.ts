/**
 * The game of Bammi:
 * - The board is a grid of cells, distributed in areas.
 * - Each area has a pie dish.
 * - Each dish has slots equal to the number of connected areas.
 * - All dishes start empty.
 * - On your turn, click an unclaimed or your own area to add a slice to its dish and claim it.
 * - If a dish is full (slices == slots), adding a slice causes an explosion:
 *   - The dish keeps 1 slice, the rest are removed.
 *   - Each connected area gets 1 slice, and is claimed by the exploding player.
 *   - Explosions can chain if connected dishes also become full.
 * - You win by claiming all areas.
